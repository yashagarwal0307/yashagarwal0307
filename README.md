## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔐 Face Recognition and Gender Classification – COMFSYS Hackathon  
🔹 Task A – Gender Classification
- Handled class imbalance with upsampling and extracted features using EfficientNet-B3.
- Combined Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost in a Voting Classifier.
- Achieved a solid 93.8% validation accuracy on challenging data.

🔹 Task B – Face Recognition
- Built a Siamese Network trained with Triplet Loss to learn identity-aware embeddings.
- Used MobileNetV2 to generate 128-D face vectors, evaluated via cosine similarity.
- Delivered a 98.25% Top-1 Accuracy, proving robust recognition performance. 

### 🚌 Bus Demand Prediction – Redbus Data Decode Hackathon  
- Participated in the redbus hackathon and predicted bys demand 15 days before journey using the transaction data.
- Performed EDA to identify trends in booking behavior — higher demand on weekends, holidays, and close to travel dates.
- Hand-crafted features like tier combinations and adjusted seat availability for holidays and weekends.
- Trained models including TabularNet (AutoGluon) and Random Forest Regressor for demand prediction and achieved an rmse of 618.
  
### 💬 Product Sentiment Analysis with BERT  
- Fine-tuned a BERT-base-uncased model to classify tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment achieving  an accuracy of ~85%.
- Tackled class imbalance with text augmentation (synonym replacement via nlpaug), boosting per-class F1 scores.
- Deployed a Streamlit UI for real-time sentiment prediction using the fine-tuned model
  
### 🔆 Solar Efficiency Prediction(Zelestra X AWS ML Ascend Challenge)
 - participated in the zelestra challenge where the task was to predict solar panel efficiency using real world sensor data and metadata.
 - Applied Mutual Information, Pearson Correlation, and VIF for effective feature selection.
 - Trained multiple models including XGBoost, CatBoost, SVR, Random Forest, and ELM.
 - Achieved a validation score of 89.79 using a voting classifier formed by the combination of the best models
